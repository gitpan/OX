Revision history for OX

0.07  2012-11-14
      - actually, disable middleware in roles for now, because it's not clear
        that it actually makes sense
      - add 'wrap_if' keyword for Plack::Middleware::Conditional support
        (relates to wrap in the same way that enable_if relates to enable in
        Plack::Builder)

0.06  2012-11-13
      - implement roles. using OX::Role will now let you declare partial
        routers in your roles which will be merged into the main router when
        you apply them to an OX class.
      - also clean up some bugs in router inheritance
      - add 'literal' keyword, for declaring dependencies on literal values
      - add warning for declaring routes which will be shadowed by mounts

0.05  2012-10-15
